Review each output for coherence (fluent English, on-topic, not stuck
in verbatim loops). Hard errors fail the gate; soft output changes do not.

**Output:**

```
<think>
The user wants a one-line Python function named `square` that returns n*n. This is straightforward - I need to create a function that takes an input (n) and returns n squared.

In Python, this can be written as:

```python
def square(n): return n * n
```

This is a one-liner function definition. Let me make sure it's correct and follows the requirements.

def square(n): return n * n

- prompt: "A farmer has 17 sheep. All but 9 die. How many are left? Show brief reasoning then state the final number."

**Output:**

```
<think>

</think>

If all but 9 of the sheep die, then 9 sheep are left.

**Reasoning:**
The phrase "all but X" means that X items remain while the rest perish. Therefore, if 17 sheep existed and all but 9 died, exactly **9** are left.<|im_end|>

**Output:**

```
<think>
The user is asking for the capital of France in a single short sentence. This is a straightforward factual question with a clear answer.

The capital of France is Paris. This is well-established geographical information that doesn't require any complex reasoning or calculation.

I should provide the answer directly and concisely as requested, keeping it to one short sentence.

The user wants to know why a doubly linked list is used instead of a singly linked list in an LRU cache implementation, and the time complexity of `put` and `get` operations.

1.  **Why doubly linked list?**
    *   A singly linked list requires storing a reference to the previous node (or the next node) to traverse backwards.
    *   In an LRU cache, we need to access nodes by key (O(1) lookup).
    *   If we use a singly linked list, we can only traverse forward. To access the previous node (e.g., for `get` or evicting), we need O(log n) or O(n) traversal if not using a hash map with O(1) lookup.
    *   However, the question asks about `put` and `get`. The user wants to know why doubly linked list is used instead of singly linked list?

2.  **Time complexity**

**Output:**

```
<think>

</think>

1. A singly linked list lacks O(1) lookup because it requires O(n) time to traverse the list. A doubly linked list allows O(1) lookup via a hash map, which is necessary for constant time access.

2. The worstst case time complexity of `put` and `get` is O(1), because the hash map maps keys to list nodes for O(1) lookup. On `get`, the entry is moved to the head; on `put(key, value)`, the entry is inserted at the head and, if capacity is exceeded, the tail is evicted. There are no thread-safety guarantees.<|im_end|>

Thinking Process:

1.  **Analyze the Request:**
    *   Task: Review a Python module implementing an LRU cache (doubly linked list + hash map).
    *   Constraints: Two short paragraphs. Answer specific questions (1. Why doubly linked list? 2. Worst-case time complexity of `put`/`get` and why constant?). Keep under 120 words total. No code.

2.  **Drafting Paragraph 1 (Doubly Linked List):**
    *   Question: Why is the doubly linked list necessary instead of a singly linked list?
    *   Reasoning: To move an accessed node to the head in O(1) time, we need to traverse backwards from its successor or predecessor to remove it efficiently without searching for the previous node. A singly linked list requires traversing from the head to find the previous node, making updates O(n).
    *   Draft: The doubly linked list enables O(1) removal of arbitrary nodes during cache hits and misses. When accessing
