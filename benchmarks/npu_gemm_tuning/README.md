# NPU int8 GEMM tuning loop

A reproducible loop for tuning an int8 GEMM on the Strix Halo NPU (gfx1151 +
aie2p / XDNA2). Each iteration builds one `whole_array` matmul config, runs it
on the NPU through the **compiled C++ host**, and logs sustained throughput as a
CSV row so configs are directly comparable across runs.

## Why C++ host, not the python harness

`tune.sh` drives the compiled C++ host (`whole_array.exe`) for both build and
run. It is known-good and the CSV baselines below were all measured through it,
so it stays the reference path.

**CORRECTED 2026-07-31.** This section previously claimed the python harness
"segfaults loading the `mlir_aie` native MLIR bindings under Python 3.14
(independent of the kernel and of the source/wheel version)". That diagnosis was
wrong. The cause was the venv's `mlir_aie` **wheel shadowing the build tree** —
`import aie` resolved to `~/.venv/.../site-packages/mlir_aie/python/aie` rather
than `$MLIR_AIE_DIR/build/python/aie`, so the native bindings loaded did not
match the source tree the design was generated from.

With `PYTHONPATH=$MLIR_AIE_DIR/build/python` set, the python path works on this
box under Python 3.14:

```
$ python3 programming_examples/basic/vector_scalar_mul/vector_scalar_mul.py --warmup 2 --iters 5
NPU time     (avg/min/max us): 147.6 / 128.6 / 159.3
PASS!
```

`tune.sh` now exports that `PYTHONPATH` itself and hard-fails if the built `aie`
package is absent. The same shadowing broke the C++-host build outright once the
source tree moved onto `origin/main` (`ImportError: cannot import name
'CompileTime' from 'aie.iron'`), since the design generator is python either
way. Full write-up: `docs/npu/flm-refe-log.md`, 2026-07-31.

## Run

```bash
./tune.sh                                  # default config matrix
./tune.sh "4096 4096 4096 64 128 64 8"     # one explicit "M K N m k n cols"
WARMUP=10 ITERS=50 ./tune.sh               # steadier timing
```

Toolchain paths are LOCAL to halo and overridable via env (`MLIR_AIE_DIR`,
`HIPFIRE_NPU_VENV`, `XRT_SETUP`, `DEV`, `DTYPE_IN/OUT`, `PEAK_TOPS`). Defaults
match this machine; nothing here is committed assuming these paths exist
elsewhere.

## Baseline (2026-07-04)

Stock `whole_array`, int8 (i8/i8, int32 accumulate in-register):

| config | throughput | % of 55 TOPS peak |
|---|---|---|
| 4096³, 8 cols | ~6.2 TOPS | ~11% |
| 4096³, 4 cols | ~3.5 TOPS | ~6% |

Bottleneck (roofline): **not** DRAM-bound (AI≈2740 op/byte ≫ ~200 machine
balance) — the loss is on-chip **L2 memtile→L1 feeding + fill/drain**, not
compute width (8-col only helped 1.76× at 4096³, 0× at 2048³).

## Tuning levers, in priority order

1. **L2→L1 feeding / buffering depth** (the diagnosed bottleneck). Exposed knobs
   reachable from `tune.sh`: MAC tile `m/k/n` (reuse per L1 load) and layout
   `b/c_col_maj`. Deeper: the memtile double-buffer depth and tile shapes inside
   `whole_array.py` / `makefile-common` — edit the design, then re-measure here.
   The AMD `programming_examples/ml/{resnet,bottleneck}` designs are the
   reference for how to stage memtile→L1 well.
2. **Microkernel** (`aie_kernels/aie2p/mm.cc`) — already vectorized (`aie::mmul`
   + `chess_prepare_for_pipelining` + 2× unroll); lower priority.
3. **Columns** — already maxed at 8; diminishing returns confirm feeding-bound.

L1 is 64 KB/tile: `dtype_out=i8` (C buffer `m*n*1*2buf`), `i32` overflows.

## Output

`results/tune-<utc>.csv`:
`utc,dtype_in,dtype_out,M,K,N,m,k,n,cols,warmup,iters,avg_us,avg_gflops,tops,pct_peak,status`
