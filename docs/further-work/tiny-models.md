# Further work: tiny-model testing

Open follow-ups for the tiny-model testing system (working name: **tiny model
gates**; today this is the seeded random-init fixtures + the `tiny_quant` eval
battery / `tests/tiny-quant-gate.sh`). The system itself is landed and documented; adding a family is covered by
[`docs/howto/add-tiny-quant-family.md`](../howto/add-tiny-quant-family.md). These
are the loose ends, roughly in priority order.

## 1. No automated gate runs the tiny-quant *quality* matrix (highest value)

CI (`tests/no-gpu-ci.sh` → `.github/workflows/no-gpu-ci.yml`) gates only the **CPU
plumbing**: the fixture unit tests + the emit→quantize→arch-detect roundtrip
(`tests/fixture-roundtrip-nogpu.sh`, all families) + compile-checks of the battery
and `tiny_quant_probe`. The pre-commit hook now uses Git's staged path list via
`tests/tiny-affected-gate.sh` to run the smallest covered `tiny_quant` family set
first, then escalates to the large coherence battery on failure, missing tiny
coverage, or inconclusive rows. What is still missing is a **GPU CI / scheduled
fleet** run of the KLD / collect matrix — the part that caught the cross-arch MoE
NaN — on validation boxes.

So a future dequant-kernel or quant regression would not be caught automatically.

- **Do:** add a **GPU CI or scheduled fleet job** that runs
  `tiny-affected-gate.sh --base <protected-branch> --require-coverage` on PRs and
  `tiny-quant-gate.sh` as a periodic full matrix on the validation boxes
  (gfx1103 + halo/gfx1151). Model it on however the other GPU gates are triggered.
- **Don't:** put the GPU matrix in the pre-commit hook — per-commit GPU minutes +
  GPU-lock contention train people to `git commit --no-verify`, which defeats the
  correctness tripwires that legitimately live there.
- Optional, low value: a scoped `cargo test -p hipfire-quantize fixture` in the
  pre-commit front tier (≈1s, gated on `fixture.rs`/`tiny_harness.rs`/
  `executor_tinyquant.rs` being staged) — only helps no-GPU dev boxes.

## 2. minimax topk GPU-faults on gfx1151

`minimax` (arch 10) faults the GPU on gfx1151 in `deepseek4_moe_topk_bias_aware`
(VMFault / coredump). It works fine on gfx1103. It's currently excluded from the
gfx1151 record via `HIPFIRE_TINYQUANT_FAMILIES`, so minimax has **no gfx1151
baseline**.

- **Caveat to rule out first:** the failure was observed from an SSH `git worktree`
  whose kernel cache forced a JIT recompile (`pre-compiled blob has no hash file,
  recompiling`). It may be a bad-recompile artifact rather than a true kernel bug.
- **Do:** reproduce from halo's **canonical pre-warmed-cache environment** (not an
  ad-hoc worktree — a fault wedges the shared GPU). If it still faults with the
  cached kernel, it's a real gfx1151 topk bug; fix it and drop the
  `HIPFIRE_TINYQUANT_FAMILIES` exclusion, then record the gfx1151 minimax baseline.

## 3. llama has a gfx1103 baseline only

`llama` (arch 0) was added with gfx1103 baselines. Record gfx1151 on halo when
convenient — the toolchain env needed for a non-interactive SSH record is in the
HOWTO ("Recording baselines on another GPU"). gfx1151 currently covers the four
non-minimax, non-llama families.

## 4. Pre-commit hooks not enabled in this clone

`git config core.hooksPath` is unset, so `.githooks/pre-commit` (the GPU
fixture-golden tripwire + coherence battery) doesn't run locally. Enable with
`git config core.hooksPath .githooks` if you want the local tripwire active. Note
the pre-commit hook is **not** wired to the tiny tests (its only tiny step is the
GPU golden tripwire); see item 1.

## 5. Open design choice: missing-baseline status

A tiny-quant cell with no committed baseline currently reports **Skip** ("no
committed baseline (run --record)"), `Pass` only under `--record`. The hard-fail
checks (non-finite / zero-token / crash) still fire regardless. The stricter
alternative is **Fail** unless `--record` or an explicit allow-missing env var —
forces baselines to exist but blocks a brand-new GPU arch from going green until
recorded. We chose Skip (non-blocking, honest, mirrors fixture-golden's
"inconclusive"). Revisit if drift-without-a-baseline becomes a real foot-gun.

## 6. More families / variants

DeepSeek4 text-core coverage is now in the tiny gates: the fixture exercises
Q/O-LoRA, Hyper-Connections, score-routed MoE, shared experts, native MQ2-Lloyd
routed experts, forward/KLD, state hashing, and collect. DeepSeek4
compressed-KV/indexer coverage is also in the tiny gates as
`deepseek4_compressed`, including ratio-4 compressor/indexer tensor loading,
collect, KLD, and long state hashing. DeepSeek4 MTP draft-forward coverage is
in the tiny gates as `deepseek4_mtp`: it loads `mtp.0.*`, runs the main decode
to seed `mtp_last_hidden`, then hashes/KLD-checks logits returned by
`mtp_forward`.

Gemma4 PLE/KV-sharing is covered by `gemma4_ple`, and Gemma4 dense-MoE is
covered by `gemma4_moe`; both run forward/KLD, state hashing, and collect. The
Qwen3.5-VL fixture is covered by `qwen3_5_vl`: it loads the composite
`text_config` + `vision_config` artifact, runs a synthetic vision-tower forward,
then feeds the resulting visual embedding through the Qwen35 text decoder's
embed-splice path. Gemma3-VL multimodal fixture coverage is in `gemma3_vl`: it
loads the arch-13 multimodal artifact, decodes a deterministic embedded PNG with
the production image preprocessor, runs `vision_forward` + `project`, splices
the image-token embeddings through `forward_step_with_embed`, then continues
forward/KLD, state hashing, and collect. dots.ocr image-path coverage is in the
tiny gates as `dots_ocr`: it loads the full Qwen2 text + Dots vision artifact,
normalizes a deterministic synthetic RGB image, extracts production-ordered
patches, runs `vision_forward`, splices four visual rows through
`forward_step_with_embed`, then continues forward/KLD, state hashing, and
collect. No remaining model family/variant gap is known in the current tiny-gate
scope. Optional higher-level work remains for dots.ocr full decoded-image +
prompt-template e2e coverage, plus the fleet/arch follow-ups above.
