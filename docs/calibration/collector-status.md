# Native Tier-1 calibration collector — status & roadmap

Status as of 2026-07-20. The resident collector and family-neutral layer-stream
engine are built and mechanism-verified. Full-scale Qwen3.5-397B production and
matched quality/admission evidence remain pending.

## Update (2026-07-20) — family-neutral native safetensors engine

`hipfire-coexistence calibrate` now emits the canonical HFQM v2
`<model>.calib.hfq` contract directly from Hugging Face BF16 or F16
safetensors. The Rust engine owns sampling, source planning, layer execution,
capture reduction, KLDREF, read accounting, and crash-safe resume;
`scripts/collect_hessian.py` is retained only as a parity/debug oracle.

Large checkpoints can use original-shard reference offload. Disk-owned layers
are loaded from the existing safetensors files on demand instead of first
copying hundreds of GiB into an Accelerate `.dat` offload directory. Dense
projections known to consume the same activation (Q/K/V, linear-attention input
projections, and gate/up pairs) share one accumulator while retaining separate
HFQM entries. This reduces the 397B model's estimated dense accumulator memory
from about 36.8 GiB to roughly 23 GiB.

The 397B path uses the native layer stream with KLDREF: embedding and host boundary
activations are materialized once, each Qwen3.5 layer consumes every corpus
microbatch while resident, and finalized layer statistics are spooled before
the weights are released. Routed-expert capture is quota- and tile-aware while
teacher routes always execute. Final norm/lm-head tensors are read once to
append KLDREF. The native read ledger rejects a duplicate teacher read, so
calibration is one source-checkpoint pass. `scripts/two_pass_quantize.py`
composes it with the existing safetensors quantizer pass and records the ledger
and artifact fingerprints in an atomic resume manifest.

Layer telemetry also persists the cost shape behind routed capture: grouped
microbatch count, active-expert sum/maximum, padding rows, gather launches,
full reduction tiles, final partial tiles, and the routed-token point where all
expert roles reached the capture limit. New fields default safely when older
resume checkpoints are loaded; those records remain explicitly distinguishable
with `launch_telemetry_recorded=false`.

Qwen3.5 and Gemma3 provide thin adapters to the same engine. Mechanism tests,
including grouped expert capture and mixed OQ4 plus BF16/F16 execution, pass on
gfx1151. A full Qwen3.5-397B production artifact and matched quality/admission
evidence are still pending; the Python oracle is not deleted until those and a
second-family production run complete.

Production preflight now estimates compact or dense Hessian payloads including
activation aliases, KLDREF bytes, the mmap boundary spool, simultaneous layer
parts plus final assembly, fixed container overhead, and a safety margin. It
reports filesystem availability during `--dry-run` and refuses an insufficient
fresh run. `--pause-after-layers N` provides a durable bounded-layer check that
can be continued with `--resume`; no partial artifact is published.

Live gfx1151 evidence on 2026-07-20:

- Qwen3.5-397B-A17B layer 0 streamed from the real 94-shard checkpoint with
  K=10 routing: 2 tokens produced 20 routed slots at both gate-up and down,
  zero dropped indices, a 203,066,368-byte capture part, 19 canonical logical
  reads totaling 15,184,552,832 bytes, and zero duplicate reads. The deliberately
  undercovered smoke correctly preserved all 512 experts.
- Gemma3-text (`medgemma-27b-text-it`) committed layer 0 and then resumed through
  layer 1. The ledger grew monotonically from 14 to 27 canonical reads and from
  3,644,369,408 to 4,470,166,528 bytes, with zero duplicates and no embedding or
  layer-0 reread.
- The same Gemma job subsequently completed all 62 layers and published a
  38,692,740,100-byte artifact with 434 Hessians, 434 imatrices, one KLDREF row,
  and a complete 809-logical/808-canonical, 54,018,004,480-byte ledger. A bounded
  `oq4++` second pass joined all seven layer-0 Hessians through AWQ+LDLQ with no
  missing/mismatched records and wrote a 249,080,134-byte HFQ.
- Qwen layer-0 fresh-process sequence-batch 1/4/8/16/32 wall times on the same
  32x8-token sample set were 6.06/4.89/4.48/4.31/4.18 seconds. All geometries
  recorded exactly 2,560 K=10 routes at gate-up and down, zero drops/duplicates,
  identical part sizes, and zero diagonal consistency error. Batch 32 is the
  bounded-layer winner, not yet the declared full-run optimum.
- A longer Qwen batch-32 layer-0 run processed 4,096 tokens and observed all
  40,960 K=10 routes at both capture roles without invalid, duplicate, or
  quota-dropped rows. It took 138.88 seconds cold with 15.1 GB maximum RSS, but
  remained deliberately undercovered: 31 experts had zero routes, only one met
  the 2,048-row floor, and 511 were preserved at high precision.
- Resume checkpoints and final artifacts now retain per-layer phase timings. A
  fresh two-token Gemma layer-0 check attributed 64.6 ms to load/upload,
  118.1 ms to execution, 1.226 s to capture serialization, 0.5 ms to finish,
  and 1.437 s to part sync/hash (2.846 s before checkpoint commit).
- Network-backed source lookahead is now family-neutral and ledger-safe. The
  engine reads the next owner's canonical physical ranges through one 8 MiB
  worker chunk into resident staging while the current layer executes, bounded
  to 16 GiB with a 32 GiB live host-memory reserve. Complete tensor views are
  consumed directly from staging and released after GPU upload. Checkpoints
  record read/staged/consumed bytes plus background, view, decode, upload,
  release, foreground-wait, and error telemetry; matched staged/page-cache/off
  production timings remain to be collected.
- On the identical 4,096-token Qwen sample set, 256/512/1,024/2,048/4,096-row
  geometries took 7.56/3.76/2.55/2.16/1.89 seconds of layer execution and
  produced identical normalized descriptors and expert telemetry. Total
  pre-checkpoint time was best at 2,048 rows due capture-write variance. At that
  row count, sequence batches 32/64/128 took 2.55/2.15/2.27 seconds; batch 64 is
  the bounded-layer target. The native CLI now uses 2,048 as its auto-tuning
  ceiling while retaining live memory estimates and allocation fallback.

The full Gemma run found a unified-memory residency hazard: mmap-backed source
pages accumulated to about 57 GB RSS and blocked ROCm SVM setup in the finalizer.
Planned safetensor views release completed ranges while canonical tied-weight
pages remain until their declared alias is consumed. Gemma completed after an
initial `posix_fadvise(DONTNEED)` fix, but Qwen's larger shard mappings proved
that file advice alone did not evict mapped PTEs: RSS reached 44.8 GB after two
layers. Adding mapping-level `MADV_DONTNEED` bounded the next production layer
to a 21.9 GB peak; a refault test verifies that released read-only bytes remain
available if a declared alias needs them later.

The tiny-corpus artifacts are mechanism/read-accounting evidence, and the batch
figures are bounded-layer throughput evidence. None establish production expert
coverage, matched KLD/PPL quality, or model admission.

## Done + verified (committed)

- **Reduction kernels** (`kernels/src/calib_reduce.hip`): `calib_sumsq_reduce_f32`
  (imatrix Σx²) + `calib_hessian_outer_f32` (Hessian Σxxᵀ, tiled). CPU-verified
  (`hipfire-rdna/examples/test_calib_reduce`).
- **Capture wiring** (`hipfire-rdna` `ActivationCapture`): `Gpu.active_capture`
  (Arc) + `capture_names` (weight-ptr→name); fired from the BF16/F16 chokepoints
  the lowered super-op path actually uses (`gemm_bf16_x_bf16_wmma_labeled`,
  `gemm_f16_batched_lmhead`). Gated on `is_none()` ⇒ non-calibration forwards are
  byte-identical. `n`/`k` passed by the gemm (the input is a shared scratch buffer
  whose shape ≠ the linear's input width). Verified: `test_capture_hook`.
- **Lib-ified collector** (`hipfire_runtime::calibration::CalibCollector`): generic
  Hessian + imatrix accumulator + `drain()` → HFQ tensors + consistency. Reusable
  by the CLI and the (future) daemon op without an arch-crate cycle.
- **Single-load CLI** (`hipfire-runtime/examples/collect_artifacts`): loads a bf16
  `.hfq` once, arms the collector, forwards over the corpus, writes a unified
  `<model>.calib.hfq`.
- **Artifacts in the `.calib.hfq`** (the unify-on-HFQ decision):
  - `<name>.hessian` [K,K] + `<name>.imatrix` [K] — verified vs the Python Hessian
    on 0.8B: 186 tensors, all K match, byte-identical size, `diag(Σxxᵀ)==Σx²`.
  - `moe_router_histogram` metadata (top1/topk per expert, per-layer, top-64
    co-occurrence = the scheduler-affinity signal) — verified on
    `qwen3.5-35b-a3b-mq4` (256 experts, top-8, all experts hit).
  - `lm_head.kldref_{idx,logit,logz}` (`--kldref`) — verified on 0.8B.
  - AWQ: derived at quant time from the captured imatrix + weights; not stored
    separately (avoids a stale-prone artifact).
- **`hfq` tool** (`hipfire-runtime` bin): `list` / `extract` / `meta-set` /
  `meta-get` — split a Hessian out, embed a jinja2 template, query provenance.
  Bundle-vs-separate is a runtime choice.

## Remaining (needs design/review — paused for the user)

1. **Daemon `Collect` op** — DONE + VERIFIED E2E (loop session 5). Additive
   `{"type":"collect",...}` handler calibrates the resident model in place (no
   reload) and writes the `.calib.hfq`, returning `{"type":"collected", output,
   n_hessian, n_calib_tokens, max_consistency}`. Data plane stays daemon-internal
   (only request + summary cross JSONL). Single-GPU (pp==1) qwen3.5-family bf16
   only; additive/gated, never on the decode hot path. Pieces: typed
   `CollectRequest`/`CollectResponse` + `DaemonRequest::Collect`/`Collected`
   (hipfire-daemon-protocol), `DaemonProcess::collect` adapter method
   (hipfire-daemon-adapter), and the daemon handler (parses msg fields directly,
   calls `qwen35::collect_calibration_artifacts` on `LoadedModel.q35_weights`,
   writes via the shared `qwen35::write_calib_artifacts`). Verified on resident
   `qwen3.5-0.8b-bf16`: `n_hessian=186, max_consistency=0.0`. The CLI subcommand
   (above) remains the standalone in-process path.
2. **eval `calibrate` battery** — DONE (loop session 4). Additive
   `BatteryId::Calibrate` (opt-in via `--battery calibrate`, not in any default
   tier) spawns the `collect_artifacts` example via the examples executor and
   asserts `[CONSISTENT]` + non-zero `n_hessian`. bf16-only (skips otherwise).
   Verified on `qwen3.5-0.8b-bf16`: pass, n_hessian=186, consistent=true.
   Also: **`hipfire collect-artifacts` CLI subcommand DONE** (forwards to the
   example, mirroring `eval`/`host-profile`).
3. **Runtime per-session MoE histogram → microbatch scheduler** — the daemon
   already calls `reset`/`take_moe_router_histogram` (`hipfire-daemon/src/main.rs`).
   Wire the per-session histogram (esp. the co-occurrence pairs) into the
   scheduler's expert-affinity grouping so the paged-expert (`WeightPager`) path
   sees fewer page-ins. Scheduler hot-path — do with review.
4. **MoE-expert capture for A3B Hessians** — DONE + VERIFIED E2E (loop session 3,
   see Update below): `build_capture_names` maps MoE dense projections (full
   Hessian) + resident routed experts (imatrix-only); the bf16 MoE forward gap
   that blocked E2E is fixed (`moe_gemv_plain`). Verified on `qwen3.6-35b-a3b-bf16`:
   350 dense Hessians CONSISTENT + 3014 routed-expert imatrices. Remaining:
   paged-mode experts (WeightPager-owned buffers — needs pager-side capture).
5. **#11 cross-model** — once (4) lands, generate full `.calib.hfq` (Hessian +
   histogram) for the two `qwen3.5/3.6-35b-a3b` models and re-run the
   importance/KLD sweep to confirm generality.

## Update (2026-06-18, loop session 2)

- **Driver lib-ified** into `qwen35::collect_calibration_artifacts` (+ `CalibOpts`/
  `CalibArtifacts`); `collect_artifacts` is now a thin CLI. The daemon op + a CLI
  subcommand reuse this driver (no duplication).
- **#11 cross-model VALIDATED on `qwen3.5-9b-bf16`** (dense, same hybrid arch):
  248 hessian tensors, `diag(Σxxᵀ)==Σx²` CONSISTENT, `[4096,4096]` Hessians. The
  collector generalizes beyond 0.8B. (Run used 16 tokens — mechanism check, not a
  full-quality Hessian.)
- **Scaling finding (RESOLVED — streaming writer shipped).** Originally the
  collector materialized ALL Hessians in RAM (`drain() -> Vec<HfqMemTensor>`,
  then `write_hfqm_package_mem`) — ~32 GB for a 9B (down-proj Hessians are
  `[mi², ]`), filling the 63 GB RAM-backed `/tmp`. Fixed with a **streaming
  writer** (`hfq::write_hfqm_package_streaming` + `CalibCollector::write_streaming`):
  the HFQM index/metadata are written first (payload sizes are deterministic from
  `k`), then each Hessian/imatrix is downloaded → normalized → written → dropped,
  one at a time. Peak host RAM is now a single tensor (~hundreds of MB) instead of
  the whole package. `collect_calibration_artifacts` writes directly to the output
  path (no `CalibArtifacts`/`write_calib_artifacts` round-trip — removed).
  Verified byte-correct on 0.8B (quantizer reads the streamed file, LDLQ engages
  on all 8 layer-0 tensors). The imatrix-default / fp16 alternatives are
  unnecessary now (no precision loss, no RAM ceiling). Still: write big-model
  artifacts to a real disk path, not the RAM-backed `/tmp`.

- **Disk-size finding (2026-06-26).** New `.calib.hfq` Hessians default to compact
  storage: exact F32 diagonal plus BF16 lower strict triangle (`quant_type=130`),
  still exposed to the quantizer as a logical symmetric `[K,K]` Hessian. This
  targets ~4× smaller Hessian payloads while preserving the diagonal exactly.
  Legacy dense F32 Hessian output remains available with
  `HIPFIRE_CALIB_HESSIAN_STORAGE=full-f32`, and the reader accepts both formats.

- **Daemon `Collect` op — design (review-gated, NOT done autonomously):** the daemon
  (`hipfire-daemon/src/main.rs`, ~9k lines) dispatches via a custom JSON
  message-parser loop (`parse_*_request` at ~8865+), not a clean `match
  DaemonRequest`; the `DaemonRequest` enum is the *client/adapter* send-side. So a
  `Collect` op spans: (a) a `DaemonRequest::Collect(CollectRequest)` variant
  (`hipfire-daemon-protocol`), (b) an adapter send method
  (`hipfire-daemon-adapter`), (c) a server-side message parser + handler in the
  daemon loop that calls `qwen35::collect_calibration_artifacts` on the resident
  `LoadedModel.q35_weights` (+ `q35_config`, the daemon's main `Gpu`, tokenizer),
  writes the `.calib.hfq`, returns the path. Data plane stays daemon-internal
  (only request + path cross JSONL). Touches the flagged-unstable daemon
  interface ⇒ do with review. The `collect_artifacts` CLI already provides the
  standalone (in-process, daemon-free) path.

## Update (2026-06-18, loop session 6) — build COMPLETE; cross-model artifact landed

The full single-load calibration-artifact collector (Phases 1–5) is **done and
verified**. Final-session work:

- **Genuine cross-model artifact (item 4 / #11).** Generated a real (128-token,
  not 8-token mechanism) `.calib.hfq` for the focus MoE model
  `qwen3.6-35b-a3b-bf16` to **real disk** (`~/.hipfire/calib/`, not tmpfs):
  **7.3 GiB**, `n_hessian=350` (dense projections, `diag(Σxxᵀ)==Σx²` CONSISTENT,
  rel-err 0.000e0), `n_imatrix=11568` (350 dense + 11218 routed-expert
  imatrix-only = 5609 distinct expert-projections covered, up from 3014 at 8
  tokens — coverage scales with tokens as expected). 35.9 s capture / ~60 s
  total on gfx1151. **Collector cross-model generality confirmed**: 0.8B (dense,
  byte-identical to the Python Hessian), 9B (`[4096,4096]` CONSISTENT), and A3B
  (MoE, dense-Hessian + per-expert-imatrix) all produce correct artifacts.
  Correctness is token-count-independent (the consistency check holds at any N),
  so this is a full-size, real-disk validation of the focus model.

- **Importance/KLD sweep re-run — DEFERRED (scoped follow-up, not done).** The
  prior sweep tooling (`scripts/roughquant_ablation_oracle.sh`, task #9) reads the
  **old binary** Hessian (`HIPFIRE_QTIP_HESSIAN=<model>.hessian.bin`) and is
  0.8B-specific (hard-coded model path, 39-rank per-channel ablation × full
  `perplexity` KLD eval). Re-running it on a fresh model needs, in order:
  1. a **format bridge** — the quantizer/`perplexity` path consumes the legacy
     `.hessian.bin`, not the new `.calib.hfq`; either teach them to read the HFQM
     `<name>.hessian` tensors (preferred) or add a `hfq extract`→`.hessian.bin`
     shim;
  2. a per-model `DUMP_RANK` diag rank-map (the sweep's input);
  3. the ablation loop itself (expensive on 9B/A3B: ~39 quant+PPL evals).
  This is a research investigation (not autonomous build work) and is gated on
  step 1 — left as a documented follow-up rather than rabbit-holed.

## f32 vs f64 Hessian accumulation (measured — f32 is sufficient)

The GPU accumulates `Σxxᵀ` in **f32** (`calib_hessian_outer_f32`). Question: does
f32 summation error over many tokens hurt LDLQ? Measured with an opt-in CPU f64
reference (`HIPFIRE_CALIB_F64_AUDIT=1` — `CalibCollector` accumulates the same
staged rows in f64 on the CPU and `drain` reports the max element-wise f32-vs-f64
rel-diff). RDNA has no f64 matrix units and only ~1:16 scalar f64, so the
reference is computed CPU-side, not on-GPU.

qwen3.5-0.8b-bf16 (gfx1151):

| tokens | max f32-vs-f64 Σxxᵀ rel-diff | collect time |
|-------:|----------------------------:|-------------:|
| 256    | 2.46e-4 | 40 s  |
| 4096   | 6.07e-4 | 570 s |

**Verdict: f32 accumulation is sufficient — f64 is NOT made the default.**
- Divergence grows sub-linearly with N (16× tokens → 2.4× error ≈ N^0.32, not the
  N¹ of catastrophic cancellation); extrapolated to a 262k-token corpus ≈ 2e-3.
- LDLQ adds a 1% diagonal ridge (`damp = 0.01·mean_diag`) before Cholesky, so even
  the extrapolated full-corpus perturbation is ~5× below the regularization the
  quantizer already applies — no quant-quality impact.
- The CPU f64 path is also 14× slower (570 s vs 40 s at 4096 tok), confirming a
  GPU f64 kernel would be the wrong trade. The audit stays as an opt-in
  diagnostic (e.g. for a future arch, or to re-check at very large N).

## Perf note
Per-token AR forward + per-token K×K outer-product is slow (~35 s / 256 tok on
gfx1151). A full 262k-token calibration wants **batched-prefill capture** (process
many tokens per forward, batch the outer-product) — the throughput follow-up.
Always state the box for perf numbers (gfx1151/Strix Halo here).

## Update (2026-06-18, loop session 3)

- **Buffer-and-flush capture landed (perf).** `CalibCollector` now stages
  activation rows into a `[FLUSH_BATCH=256, K]` buffer and runs a SINGLE batched
  `calib_hessian_outer_f32` / `calib_sumsq_reduce_f32` per 256 rows (the tiled
  GEMM is built for N≥16, so per-token N=1 wasted ~256×). Verified on
  `qwen3.5-0.8b-bf16` (gfx1151): 186 hessians, `diag(Σxxᵀ)==Σx²` CONSISTENT,
  **4.5–7.8 s** vs the prior ~35 s/256-tok. Commit 6084ade2.

- **MoE-expert capture (A3B) — capture side built + verified-by-construction.**
  `build_capture_names` now maps the MoE-layer dense projections (attention
  q/k/v/o or qkv/z/a/b/o, the router `mlp.gate`, and the shared expert
  gate/up/down) → **full Hessian** (same gemm chokepoint as the dense layers),
  and the resident routed experts (`mlp.experts.{x}.{gate_up,down}_proj`) →
  **imatrix-only**. The collector gained `CalibCollector::with_imatrix_only(substr)`:
  tensors whose name contains a substring (here `".experts."`) accumulate only
  Σx² (no [K,K] Hessian alloc / outer-product). Rationale: a full per-expert
  Hessian for A3B is **256 experts × 40 layers × [K,K] ≈ 196 GB** — does not fit
  on-GPU; the imatrix is a K-vector (~100 MB total) and is the importance signal
  AWQ-style quant needs. Dense path re-verified unchanged (0.8B: 186 hessians,
  CONSISTENT). Routed-expert names are emitted only when experts are **resident**
  (`HIPFIRE_QWEN35_PAGED_EXPERTS` unset = the default; paged mode owns buffers in
  the WeightPager and patches ptrs per-token, so capture-by-buf-ptr can't key them).

- **bf16 A3B MoE forward — RESOLVED, and A3B capture VERIFIED E2E.** The bf16 MoE
  FFN forward routes through the Ship 4.1 MoE dispatch family
  (`hipfire_runtime::llama::moe_family().run()` → `pipeline::run_moe_decode`),
  whose inner gemvs resolved via `for_gemv` — which has **no `(BF16, Plain)` entry**
  (BF16 has no scalar GEMV kernel; it uses WMMA), so the first forward token failed
  `unsupported gemv.unknown for /`. Fix (commit pending): added `moe_gemv_plain`
  (`pipeline/mod.rs`), a `weight_gemv`-style helper that short-circuits BF16 →
  `gemm_bf16_x_bf16_wmma`, applied at the 7 bf16-reachable gemv sites (router +
  3 shared on the gate side; shared-down + per-expert gate_up + down in the
  CPU-top-K fallback). Non-bf16 dtypes still go through `run_auto` unchanged
  (byte-identical for mq*/paro production — the change only touches the arm that
  previously hard-errored). **Bonus:** routing bf16 through `gemm_bf16_x_bf16_wmma`
  is exactly the capture chokepoint, so this simultaneously unblocked the forward
  AND fired the MoE capture. Verified on `qwen3.6-35b-a3b-bf16` (gfx1151, 8 tokens):
  **350 dense Hessians (CONSISTENT, rel-err 0.000e0)** + 3364 imatrices (350 dense
  + 3014 routed-expert imatrix-only), 3714 tensors. Structure confirmed via `hfq
  list`: dense projections (linear_attn in_proj_*/out_proj, full_attn q/k/v/o,
  router `mlp.gate`, shared_expert gate/up/down) carry both `.hessian [K,K]` +
  `.imatrix [K]`; routed `mlp.experts.{x}.{gate_up,down}_proj` carry `.imatrix`
  only (shapes [2048]/[512]). A full-corpus run (more tokens) covers more of the
  256×40 experts; 8 tokens hit 1507 distinct (expert,layer,proj) imatrices. Paged
  mode still uncovered (WeightPager owns buffers).
