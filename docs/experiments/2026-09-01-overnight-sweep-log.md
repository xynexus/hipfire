## Step 0 — land in-flight work · DONE

Tree was dirty on `master`; branched first.

- `563ff6f02` n-gram hoist off `DflashState` onto `LoadedModel`, plus
  `NgramState::take_live_for` and its scope-leak test.
- `d3d1f24f0` corrected `docs/perf/ddtree-vs-chain-opus.md` + `serve_real`
  step-count flag.

Corrections folded into the doc (both were errors in yesterday's draft):
- called Qwen3.6-27B "dense" — it has **48 linear-attention layers of 64**, so
  the hybrid-recurrent path *was* exercised;
- recommended budget 8 / topk 2. Real optimum is **budget 12, topk 1** =
  32.89 tok/s (2.16x AR, 3.21x chain), and topk=1 is a linear spine, not a tree.

Gate: pending below.
