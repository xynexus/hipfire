# Agentic Sidecar Training — Cost & Strategy

**Date:** 2026-04-19
**Status:** Active priority. Replaces from-scratch DFlash draft training per `dflash-from-scratch-replication.md`.

## Background

TriAttention (hipfire's sidecar) is a per-target calibration that captures band-wise statistics of pre-RoPE Q vectors from the target model's attention heads on a representative corpus. The sidecar then pairs with any compatible draft at inference to improve τ — especially on OOD or domain-specific text where the target's vanilla attention patterns don't match the draft's assumptions.

Empirical result from 2026-04-18: **agentic-corpus-calibrated sidecars produce clean `<tool_call>` output on Hermes traces** while wikitext-calibrated sidecars degenerate on the same traces with the same models. That's the domain-specialization win.

## Cost comparison — where to run sidecar cal

Sidecar calibration is **per-target** (independent of draft). For our 4-target matrix:
- Qwen3.5-4B
- Qwen3.5-9B
- Qwen3.5-27B
- Qwen3.5-35B-A3B (or 3.6-A3B when we ingest it)

Current state: CPU-bottlenecked. Per `/root/chain_logs/9b_sidecar_cal.log` timing, 9B at 1M tokens took ~2hr (only 0.8% of that was GPU utilization per `rocm-smi`). CPU-side BandAccumulator loop dominates.

### Cost scenarios

| scenario | wall time per sidecar | × 4 sidecars | unit cost | **total** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Current code, sequential on MI300X | 2 hr | 8 hr | $2/hr | **$16** |
| Current code, sequential on 7900 XTX local | 3-4 hr | 12-16 hr | $0 | **$0** |
| Current code, parallel on 8× MI300X | 2 hr (wall) | 2 hr wall, 8 cards active | $48/hr (8×) | **$96** |
| With CPU-GPU split on 7900 XTX local | 30-40 min | 2-3 hr | $0 | **$0** |
| With CPU-GPU split on 8× MI300X (parallel) | 30-40 min | 40 min wall | $48/hr | **$32** |

**Conclusion: the cheapest path is implementing CPU-GPU split and running all 4 locally on the 7900 XTX.** Zero dollars, under 3 hours wall, hardware is ours forever.

Serial on MI300X at $16 is the "if CPU-GPU split is too much work" fallback. Still cheap but loses the free-local-hardware advantage.

Parallel on 8× MI300X makes no sense for sidecar cal alone — you pay for 8 cards, only need 4, and the wall-time improvement is small. Only worth it if co-locating with 3.6-A3B draft training.

## CPU-GPU split design (primary implementation target)

### Current bottleneck

Per `crates/engine/examples/triattn_validate.rs` with CPU-side `TriAttnCalibState::add_sample`:

Per-prompt flow today:
1. GPU runs `qwen35::forward_prefill_batch` for chunk (~200-500 tokens).
2. For each FA layer, pre-RoPE Q tensor is **downloaded from GPU to host**.
3. CPU loops over Q: `16 heads × 128 bands × ~300 tokens × 8 FA layers = 4.9M BandAccumulator.add() calls` per chunk.
4. GPU is **idle** during step 3 (rocm-smi shows 0% most of the time).

For 316k chunks × 1M tokens, this totals:
- ~128 GB of Q data crossing PCIe (128 bytes per position × 1M positions × 8 layers)
- ~16 billion accumulator ops on CPU
- Wall time dominated by CPU phase, not GPU phase.

### Proposed pipelined design

Two approaches, in order of preference:

**Option A — GPU reduction kernel (cleanest, ~1 day work)**

Replace the CPU `add_sample` loop with a HIP kernel that runs on the Q tensor already in GPU memory. Kernel signature:

```c
__global__ void triattn_accumulate(
    const __half* q_device,              // [n_tokens, n_heads, head_dim]
    BandAccumulator* accs_device,         // [n_layers, n_heads, n_bands]
    int n_tokens, int n_heads, int head_dim,
    int layer_idx
);
```

Each block handles one (head, band) pair across all tokens, producing per-accumulator sum/sumsq/count via shared-memory reduction + single atomic add at the end. Classic parallel-reduce pattern.

Wire-up in `crates/engine/src/triattn.rs`:
- Replace `record_prerope_q` → add `record_prerope_q_device(layer_idx, q_device_buf)` variant.
- New tap state enum variant `CalibrateGpu` holds device-resident `accs_device` buffer.
- `finalize()` downloads the small `accs_device` buffer ONCE at end and runs the existing `BandAccumulator::finalize` per band to produce the `TriAttnCenters`.

Zero PCIe data transfer for Q during calibration. GPU stays at 100% during the accumulation. Bottleneck becomes pure target-forward throughput.

Expected speedup: **~5×** (from 100 tok/s to ~500 tok/s on MI300X, similar on 7900 XTX).

**Option B — Pipelined CPU accumulation with Rayon/SIMD (simpler, ~4hr work)**

Keep the CPU path but:
- Use `rayon::par_iter()` over heads, since accumulators for different heads are independent.
- SIMD the inner band loop (f32 sum + sumsq, complex — AVX2/AVX-512 via `std::simd` or `packed_simd`).
- Double-buffer: while CPU processes chunk N's downloaded Q, GPU runs chunk N+1's forward.

Expected speedup: ~3× from parallelization, +1-1.5× from overlap = **~4×** total.

Less clean, keeps all code in Rust, no HIP kernel debugging. Fallback if the GPU kernel hits unexpected issues on RDNA3 vs CDNA3.

### Recommendation

Do **Option A** (GPU kernel). The reduce pattern is standard enough that it's not much more risky than the pipelined version, and it gives the cleanest architecture: calibration becomes a pure GPU pipeline with a single sync at the end.

## Implementation plan

### Phase 1 — CPU-GPU split (Option A kernel)

1. Write `kernels/src/triattn_accumulate.hip` with the reduce kernel.
2. Add binding in `crates/rdna-compute/src/kernels.rs` and dispatch in `crates/rdna-compute/src/dispatch.rs`.
3. Refactor `crates/engine/src/triattn.rs`:
   - Keep existing CPU `TriAttnCalibState` as fallback (`--cpu-calib` flag).
   - New `TriAttnCalibStateGpu` holds device accs buffer.
   - Install GPU tap when `--gpu-calib` flag is set (default in MI300X + RDNA3 paths; keep CPU for RDNA1 where atomic add on fp32 might not work).
4. Validate: run agentic-corpus cal with CPU vs GPU paths on same seed corpus, verify resulting `TriAttnCenters` differ by < 1e-4 per band.
5. Bench: time 1M-token cal on 7900 XTX CPU vs GPU path. Target: ≤40 min GPU.

### Phase 2 — Run the 4-sidecar matrix locally

Once Phase 1 is proven:

```bash
# Build agentic corpus locally (first time; ~1GB cached afterwards)
bash scripts/fetch_calibration_corpus.sh --recipe agentic_xl \
    .dflash-runs/agentic_xl_corpus.txt

# Calibrate each target (sequential — no need to parallelize on 1 GPU)
for model in qwen3.5-4b.mq4 qwen3.5-9b.mq4 qwen3.5-27b.mq4 qwen3.5-35b-a3b.mq4; do
    target/release/examples/triattn_validate \
        ~/.hipfire/models/${model} \
        --corpus .dflash-runs/agentic_xl_corpus.txt \
        --sidecar ~/.hipfire/models/${model}.triattn.agentic_xl.bin \
        --max-tokens 1000000 --chunk-len 1024
done
```

Expected wall: 2-3 hours total, $0. Produces 4 agentic-specialized sidecars ready to pair with z-lab drafts.

### Phase 3 — Deploy + bench

Pair each new sidecar with z-lab's matching draft. Bench τ on:
- The 3 prompts already staged in `.dflash-runs/prompts/`
- Real Hermes agent traces (sample 20 from `agentic_corpus.txt` across the corpus)
- Production hipfire-serve with Hermes agent test harness (task #23 is already in flight)

Baseline to beat: z-lab draft alone (no sidecar) AND z-lab draft + wikitext-calibrated sidecar (existing `.triattn.bin` files). If agentic sidecar gives >10% τ lift on Hermes-style prompts, we ship.

## Parallel work — 3.6-A3B draft (when 8× cluster spins)

Only target without a z-lab baseline. Training this IS a unique research contribution regardless of where it lands on τ. Reserve for the 8× cluster window per `docs/plans/8x-cluster-launch.md`. Not blocking sidecar work.

## DDTree — future inference-time τ recovery

DDTree (arXiv:2604.12989) multiplexes drafted paths per cycle with tree-verification. Can stack on top of any draft. Our 2026-04-14 test (memory: `project_ddtree_tuning.md`) showed +130% τ on hard prompts but wall-clock SLOWER due to 30ms/cycle overhead from CPU-side tree management.

After sidecars are shipped, DDTree is the next τ lever. Likely requires porting tree-verify logic to GPU kernels; probably ~3-5 days of work. Defer until sidecar story is closed.
