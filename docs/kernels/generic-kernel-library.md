# Generic Kernel Library — Plan & Manifest

Status: **in progress** (foundation). This document is the authoritative plan
for a library of tested, dtype-generic GEMM/GEMV kernels that new model
arch crates can reuse instead of round-tripping every op through f32 or
reaching for a quant-format-specific kernel.

## Motivation

hipfire's production path is its own block-quant containers (`q8`, `hfq*`,
`mq*`). As a result the *generic* IEEE/native-dtype kernel set is sparse:
the f32 reference path is complete, but fp16/bf16 exist mostly as the GEMM
weight tier, and generic int8/int4 kernels are essentially absent (their
math lives fused inside the quant kernels). As we add more models with
varied quirks, a tested generic kernel library massively speeds bring-up.

## Scope (this phase)

- **Families:** GEMM and GEMV.
- **Dtypes (input → output):** `iu4→i32`, `iu8→i32`, `bf16→bf16`,
  `bf16→f32`, `f16→f16`, `f16→f32`.
- **Arch targets we can test now:** RDNA3 dGPU (`gfx1100`, k9lin) and
  RDNA3.5 UMA (`gfx1151`, hipx). Local dev box is `gfx1103` (Phoenix UMA),
  same RDNA3 WMMA ISA. Register-tiled/no-LDS bodies remain the default there;
  guarded LDS validation is permitted on treated hosts after confirming the
  live `amdgpu.cwsr_enable=0` setting (see status below).

All six dtype combos map to a native WMMA instruction on RDNA3/RDNA4
(verified via `third_party/amd_matrix_instruction_calculator`):

| Combo      | WMMA instruction                      |
|------------|---------------------------------------|
| `f16→f32`  | `v_wmma_f32_16x16x16_f16`             |
| `f16→f16`  | `v_wmma_f16_16x16x16_f16`             |
| `bf16→f32` | `v_wmma_f32_16x16x16_bf16`            |
| `bf16→bf16`| `v_wmma_bf16_16x16x16_bf16`           |
| `iu8→i32`  | `v_wmma_i32_16x16x16_iu8`             |
| `iu4→i32`  | `v_wmma_i32_16x16x16_iu4`             |

## Current inventory (audit 2026-06-20)

GEMM (existing kernels accumulate-and-store **F32**):

| Combo      | Status   | Existing kernel / note |
|------------|----------|------------------------|
| `f16→f32`  | ✅ exists | `gemm_f16_wmma` (Wf16×Xf32), `gemm_f16_x_f16_wmma` (Wf16×Xf16→F32) |
| `bf16→f32` | ✅ exists | `gemm_bf16_x_bf16_wmma` (named bf16×bf16 but **stores F32**) + `_gfx1151_m128` LDS large-M variant |
| `f16→f16`  | ✅ done   | `gemm_f16_f16_wmma` (no-LDS, F32 accum + f16 store); parity test `examples/parity_gemm_f16_f16_wmma.rs`, validated on gfx1103 |
| `bf16→bf16`| ✅ done   | `gemm_bf16_bf16_wmma` (no-LDS, F32 accum + bf16 store); parity test `examples/parity_gemm_bf16_bf16_wmma.rs`, validated on gfx1103 |
| `iu8→i32`  | ✅ done   | `gemm_iu8_i32_wmma` (signed int8, no-LDS, clamp=false); parity test `examples/parity_gemm_iu8_i32_wmma.rs`, EXACT match on gfx1103 |
| `iu4→i32`  | ✅ done   | `gemm_iu4_i32_wmma` (signed int4, gfx1103-generic, no-LDS, clamp=false); parity test `examples/parity_gemm_iu4_i32_wmma.rs`, EXACT match on gfx1103 |

GEMV (one wave32 per output row, wave-shuffle reduce, zero LDS; same-dtype
weight+vector inputs; B=1 matvec). All validated on gfx1103 via
`examples/parity_gemv_generic.rs` (floats ULP-exact, ints EXACT):

| Combo      | Status   | Kernel |
|------------|----------|--------|
| `f16→f32`  | ✅ done   | `gemv_f16_f32` |
| `f16→f16`  | ✅ done   | `gemv_f16_f16` |
| `bf16→f32` | ✅ done   | `gemv_bf16_f32` |
| `bf16→bf16`| ✅ done   | `gemv_bf16_bf16` |
| `iu8→i32`  | ✅ done   | `gemv_iu8_i32` |
| `iu4→i32`  | ✅ done   | `gemv_iu4_i32` |

(Pre-existing `gemv_f16_xf32` keeps F32 *activation* precision — a separate
contract from the same-dtype `gemv_f16_f32`.)

## Arch-class strategy

The win/loss profile differs by memory architecture, not just by gfx id.
Findings from `third_party/fsr4-rdna3-optimization` (gfx1151) plus our own
gfx1103 hazard note drive a **register-tiled (no-LDS) body on UMA** vs an
**LDS-staged body on dGPU**:

- UMA iGPUs share **system DRAM** with the CPU. Naive LDS staging of small
  working sets *regressed* on gfx1151 (fsr4 O10–O13). LDS still wins when it
  amortizes reuse across warps for large M (cf. `gemm_bf16_x_bf16_wmma_gfx1151_m128`).
- **Scalar INT8 MAC beat the packed-dot intrinsic by ~32% on gfx1151**
  (much smaller on gfx1100). The packed/DP4A default is wrong on UMA.
- **TREATED HOST HAZARD:** on `gfx1103` (Phoenix), multi-wave barrier/LDS-heavy
  kernels could wedge the GPU during CWSR preemption (HMM invalidation → MES
  hang/reset → sticky HIP 719). Both maintained Phoenix hosts now boot with
  `amdgpu.cwsr_enable=0`, which passes the former fail-side workload under
  proven eviction. This is not an upstream fix: prefer register tiling, verify
  the live CWSR setting before LDS testing, and report any LDS hang, HIP 719,
  MES event, nondeterminism, or parity drift immediately.

Selection helper to add (taxonomy gap): `arch_caps` groups `gfx1103` under
`is_rdna3` but in **neither** `is_rdna3_dgpu` (1100/1/2) **nor**
`is_rdna3p5` (1150/1/2). The kernel UMA class must be
`is_gfx1103() || is_rdna3p5()`. Add an `is_rdna3_uma()` cap rather than
open-coding this at every call site.

Each kernel source carries both bodies behind arch macros (the JIT compiles
per `self.arch` via `compiler.compile`), or ships a `.gfx1151.hip` sibling
selected in Rust — mirror whichever the neighbouring kernels already use.

### Lesson: 16-bit-output WMMA does NOT chain (use F32 accumulate)

For `bf16→bf16` and `f16→f16`, do **not** accumulate with the 16-bit-output
WMMA (`v_wmma_bf16_16x16x16_bf16` / `…_f16_…_f16`) across K-tiles. Re-feeding
the packed 16-bit `C` accumulator does not line up with the even-slot `D`
write, so for K>16 the chain silently drops magnitude (measured: gpu −4.09 vs
ref −6.5 at K=512; single-tile K=16 was exact). Instead accumulate in **F32**
via `v_wmma_f32_16x16x16_{bf16,f16}` and round to 16-bit only on store. This is
more accurate AND robust; "→bf16/→f16" denotes the output dtype, not the
accumulation precision. `gemm_bf16_bf16_wmma` does exactly this; `f16→f16` will
follow the same shape.

## Dispatch / wiring pattern (per kernel)

1. `kernels/src/<name>.hip` (+ optional `kernels/src/gfx1151/<name>.gfx1151.hip`).
2. `pub const <NAME>_SRC: &str = include_str!(...)` in `crates/hipfire-rdna/src/kernels.rs`.
3. `pub fn <name>(&mut self, …)` in `dispatch.rs`: `bind_thread` →
   `ensure_kernel(name, SRC, entry)` → params → `launch_kernel`.
4. Numeric test vs an f32 CPU reference (small M/K/N), gated to run only on
   an RDNA3 GPU.

## Documented omissions (circle back)

- **gfx906 / MI50 / GCN5.1 (real target — cheap 32 GB HBM2, ~1 TB/s):**
  NO matrix cores; not modeled by the matrix calculator. Needs a separate
  V_DOT/scalar codegen path (wave64): `iu8→i32` via `v_dot4_i32_i8`,
  `f16→{f16,f32}` via `v_dot2_f32_f16`/`v_pk_fma_f16`. **No bf16 ALU** →
  bf16 must upconvert to f32 (correct, not fast). **No int4 dot** → unpack
  iu4→iu8 + `v_dot4`, or scalar. Deferred: untestable from current fleet
  position; build after RDNA3/3.5 set lands.
- **gfx1201 / RDNA4 (hiptrx):** strict WMMA superset. Deferred extras worth
  designing the API to accommodate: fp8/bf8 matmul
  (`v_wmma_f32_16x16x16_{fp8,bf8}_*`), wide int4 (`…16x16x32_iu4`), and
  SWMMAC 2:4 sparse (`v_swmmac_*`).
- **gfx1103 LDS-staged bodies:** may now be perf/coherence-tested on a treated
  gfx1103 host after confirming `amdgpu.cwsr_enable=0` and acquiring the shared
  GPU lock. Keep register/no-LDS paths as production defaults and preserve a
  CPU/reference comparison. Any strange LDS behavior must be reported with the
  launch shape, LDS byte count, live CWSR value, and first-failure dmesg.
- **fp8 on RDNA3:** no native fp8 WMMA — not a gap on gfx1100/1103/1151.

## Build order

1. ✅ Foundation (this doc) + `is_rdna3_uma()` cap helper.
2. ✅ GEMM tier complete on gfx1103: `bf16→bf16`, `f16→f16`, `iu8→i32`,
   `iu4→i32` all built + parity-tested (floats: F32-accum+round store; ints:
   exact). `bf16→f32` / `f16→f32` reused from pre-existing kernels.
3. ✅ GEMV tier complete on gfx1103: all six built (one wave32 per row,
   wave-shuffle reduce, zero LDS) + parity-tested via `parity_gemv_generic`.
4. Numeric tests for each (currently validated on gfx1103; re-run on
   gfx1100/gfx1151 when fleet access is available).
5. Later phases: gfx906 V_DOT path, gfx1201 fp8/sparse; perf tuning (GEMV is
   bandwidth-bound — consider vectorized/`dot`-instruction loads on UMA).
