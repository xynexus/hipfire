# Coherence battery — replaces the byte-exact MQ4 quality gate.
#
# Rationale: byte-exact comparison blocks legitimate numerical-correctness
# improvements (e.g., norm convention fixes that change output for the
# better). This gate instead runs a small fixed matrix of (model × prompt)
# through the daemon and writes a markdown report that a human/agent
# reviewer reads before committing. The gate itself only fails on hard
# daemon/error signals (panics, non-zero exit, zero tokens emitted);
# correctness is assessed qualitatively on the report.
#
# Exit codes:
#   0  battery ran clean — open the report and inspect coherence
#   1  a test hit a hard error (daemon panic / zero tokens / timeout)
#   2  build or environment error
#
# Report destination: /tmp/coherence-<timestamp>.md (or $HIPFIRE_COHERENCE_OUT)
#
# Modes:
#   ./scripts/coherence-gate.sh          # short battery (~2-4 min)
#   ./scripts/coherence-gate.sh --full   # add A3B tests (~6-10 min)
