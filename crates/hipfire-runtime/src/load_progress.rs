//! Structured model-load progress sink.
//!
//! Model loaders (`hfq.rs` here, plus the per-arch loaders in the
//! `hipfire-arch-*` crates) walk their layers synchronously and historically
//! only `eprintln!`'d "loading layer N/M" for humans. That human line was being
//! scraped off the daemon's stderr to drive the chat UI's load bar — fragile
//! (couples to log wording; six different format strings) and, on a piped
//! stderr, deadlock-prone on non-UTF-8 bytes.
//!
//! Instead, loaders call [`report`] at the same points. The daemon installs a
//! sink (via [`set_sink`]) before a load that serializes each report into a
//! `load_progress` frame on its framed stdout channel — the same structured,
//! UTF-8-safe path used for tokens and other events. When no sink is installed
//! (CLI loads, tests, eval batteries), [`report`] is a cheap no-op.
//!
//! This lives in `hipfire-runtime` because it is the lowest crate reachable by
//! every loader: `hfq.rs` is in this crate, and the arch crates all depend on
//! it. The daemon (which also depends on this crate) is the only installer.
