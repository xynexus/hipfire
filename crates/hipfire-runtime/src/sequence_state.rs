//! Unified per-sequence decode state — the container half of the family-seam
//! `Mixer` state model (P2c of
//! `docs/plans/2026-06-23-seam-finish-and-mamba2.md`).
//!
//! # Why
//!
//! Today a loaded model's per-decode state is a *cluster* of parallel fields on
//! `LoadedModel`: `kv_cache: Option<KvCache>` for the attention layers, plus a
//! separate `DeltaNetState` (inside the qwen35 session state) for the recurrent
//! layers, plus assorted `q35_*` bookkeeping. A hybrid stack (qwen35 FA+DeltaNet)
//! carries both; a pure-attention stack carries only KV; a **pure-SSM stack
//! (Mamba-2) carries only recurrent state and no KV at all** — but there is no
//! single object that expresses "the state for this sequence" across those cases.
//!
//! [`SequenceState`] is that object: one container, keyed by the model's
//! [`MixerProfile`], owning an optional [`KvCache`] (attention layers) and an
//! optional boxed [`RecurrentMixerState`] (short-conv / DeltaNet / Mamba-2). The
//! **no-KV path falls out**: a profile with `needs_kv_cache() == false` builds a
//! `SequenceState` with `kv == None`.
//!
//! ## Deliberately a container, not a buffer-merge
//!
//! This does NOT fold `KvCache`'s 49 quant-codec constructors and
//! `DeltaNetState`'s S-matrix/conv storage into one buffer enum — those are
//! genuinely different (attention KV codecs vs. recurrent state) and stay in
//! their own types. The unification is at the *ownership / dispatch* level.
//!
//! ## Hot path stays monomorphized
//!
//! The boxed `dyn RecurrentMixerState` is a coarse, per-model handle. Arch
//! serving code recovers the concrete state (`&DeltaNetState`) for its
//! per-token forward via [`SequenceState::recurrent_as`] (an `Any` downcast),
//! so the inner loop never pays dyn dispatch — matching the seam's "forward
//! stays monomorphized" rule.
