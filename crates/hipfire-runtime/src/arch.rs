//! The bring-up contract for a hipfire architecture. Implement this
//! trait in your arch crate (e.g. `hipfire-arch-qwen35`) to plug a
//! model into the runtime. Generation, sampling, eviction, spec
//! decode, paging, prompt framing, and EOS filtering all live in
//! the runtime crate; the arch contributes only the model-specific
//! pieces.
//!
//! Default impls cover the Qwen3.5 family conventions. Override only
//! what diverges for your arch.
//!
//! # Worked examples
//!
//! - `crates/hipfire-arch-template/` — minimum-viable stub, ~50 lines of
//!   trait-impl with explanatory comments. Copy-paste this directory
//!   as a starting point for a new arch.
//! - `crates/hipfire-arch-qwen35/src/arch.rs` — full production impl
//!   for the Qwen3.5 hybrid DeltaNet + MoE family. Read this for the
//!   bar: how `config_from_hfq` walks the JSON metadata, how
//!   `load_weights` drives the weight pager, how `new_state` allocates
//!   GPU scratch.
//! - `crates/hipfire-arch-llama/src/arch.rs` — second impl, dense
//!   LLaMA / Mistral / plain-Qwen3 family. Demonstrates the trait at
//!   facade-stage (forward body still in `hipfire-runtime::llama`,
//!   PR 14 will physically split).
//!
//! # Why forward isn't on the trait
//!
//! Forward-pass dispatch is intentionally NOT routed through this
//! trait. Reasons:
//!   1. Forward signatures vary heavily across arches (number of
//!      buffers, KV layout, hybrid-vs-dense paths, vision conditioning,
//!      MoE expert management). Forcing one trait shape would either
//!      bloat the contract or hide essential parameters behind opaque
//!      slots.
//!   2. Forward dispatch is hot-path. Static dispatch via concrete-type
//!      function calls keeps the call graph fully inlinable; dyn-trait
//!      dispatch in the inner loop costs measurable tok/s on small
//!      models.
//!   3. The trait's job is BRING-UP scaffolding (load → instantiate →
//!      generation-loop wiring), not runtime polymorphism. Once an arch
//!      is loaded, the daemon/CLI knows the concrete type at compile
//!      time.

/// arena (`hipfire_state::GenericSequenceStateArena`) and the request/handle/
/// descriptor types it consumes already exist — the method param types here are
/// those existing `hipfire_state` types, not new ones.
///
/// # Ownership taxonomy
///
/// [`SessionServingBackend::state_arena_backend`] reports how this backend's
/// pages are owned ([`SequenceStateArenaBackend::Qwen35Wrapped`] vs
/// [`SequenceStateArenaBackend::BackendOwned`]); the scheduler/batcher reads it
/// for cross-session accounting. **Both ownership modes expose the full session
/// op set on this trait** (activate/save/reset/fork/checkpoint/release) — the
/// `BackendOwned` arches (lfm2/minimax/nemotron) are not limited to describe-only
/// at the trait level.
///
/// # Object-safe
///
/// All methods take `&self`/`&mut self`, `&mut Gpu`, slices, and the borrowed
/// `hipfire_state` request structs, returning owned values — so the daemon can
/// hold `Box<dyn SessionServingBackend>` and the dyn boundary is per-request, not
/// per-token.
///
/// Prefill/materialize orchestration (`run_generate_batch_prefill_serial`) and

/// driver surface, refined in S2/S3 as the per-arch bodies move onto the backend.
///

///
/// Intentionally a standalone trait, not `: ServingBackend`. On today's
/// single-resident-slot daemon the session state (incl. the shared `seq_pos` /
/// `conversation_tokens` cursor) lives in `LoadedModel`, so the C0 hoist

/// `LoadedModel` is not itself a `ServingBackend`. Once the per-session-slot
/// restructure (docs/plans/2026-06-29-concurrent-session-execution.md, C1) moves
