//! The bring-up contract for a hipfire architecture. Implement this
//! trait in your arch crate (e.g. `hipfire-arch-qwen35`) to plug a
//! model into the runtime. Generation, sampling, eviction, spec
//! decode, paging, prompt framing, and EOS filtering all live in
//! the runtime crate; the arch contributes only the model-specific
//! pieces.
//!
//! Default impls cover the Qwen3.5 family conventions. Override only
//! what diverges for your arch.
//!
//! # Worked examples
//!
//! - `crates/hipfire-arch-toy/` — minimum-viable stub, ~50 lines of
//!   trait-impl with explanatory comments. Copy-paste this directory
//!   as a starting point for a new arch.
//! - `crates/hipfire-arch-qwen35/src/arch.rs` — full production impl
//!   for the Qwen3.5 hybrid DeltaNet + MoE family. Read this for the
//!   bar: how `config_from_hfq` walks the JSON metadata, how
//!   `load_weights` drives the weight pager, how `new_state` allocates
//!   GPU scratch.
//! - `crates/hipfire-arch-llama/src/arch.rs` — second impl, dense
//!   LLaMA / Mistral / plain-Qwen3 family. Demonstrates the trait at
//!   facade-stage (forward body still in `hipfire-runtime::llama`,
//!   PR 14 will physically split).
//!
//! # Why forward isn't on the trait
//!
//! Forward-pass dispatch is intentionally NOT routed through this
//! trait. Reasons:
//!   1. Forward signatures vary heavily across arches (number of
//!      buffers, KV layout, hybrid-vs-dense paths, vision conditioning,
//!      MoE expert management). Forcing one trait shape would either
//!      bloat the contract or hide essential parameters behind opaque
//!      slots.
//!   2. Forward dispatch is hot-path. Static dispatch via concrete-type
//!      function calls keeps the call graph fully inlinable; dyn-trait
//!      dispatch in the inner loop costs measurable tok/s on small
//!      models.
//!   3. The trait's job is BRING-UP scaffolding (load → instantiate →
//!      generation-loop wiring), not runtime polymorphism. Once an arch
//!      is loaded, the daemon/CLI knows the concrete type at compile
//!      time.

/// - `Config` — model-shape constants parsed from HFQ metadata.

///   MoE topology, RoPE params.
/// - `Weights` — GPU-resident model weights. Owns `WeightTensor`
///   handles plus any host-side metadata for the weight pager.
/// - `State` — GPU-resident per-decode scratch (KV cache, attention
///   workspace, recurrent state for hybrid archs).
///
/// # Required: methods
///
/// See per-method docs below.
///
/// # Optional: override hooks
///
