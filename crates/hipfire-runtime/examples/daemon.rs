// ─── Probe-mode `committed` event emitter ────────────────────────────────
//
// When `HIPFIRE_EMIT_TOKEN_IDS=1` is set, the daemon emits a
// `{"type":"committed",...}` event for every token it commits (i.e. every
// time a sampled token is appended to `streamed_tokens` /
// `conversation_tokens`). This is a parallel stream alongside the
// existing `{"type":"token","text":"..."}` events; it carries the raw
// token ID, the per-request position, and ms-since-request-start.
//
// Why a parallel stream and not a `tok_id` field on the existing token
// event: `EosFilter` can hold/merge/strip/stop bytes across multiple
// committed tokens (many-to-one and zero-to-one relationships); a
// `tok_id` field on a text event would lie about which token produced
// the visible chunk. The runtime-protective synthetic emit at the
// `</think>` force-close site is intentionally NOT paired with a
// `committed` event, because no token was actually committed there.
//
// Off by default — env var read once on first call. The probe binary
// (`examples/coherence_probe.rs`) sets the env on the daemon child it
// spawns. Existing JSONL clients see no change.

/// LRU-bounded fingerprint→tokens cache for assistant-turn replay
/// (`asst_turn_cache`). Holds the verbatim token sequence each
/// assistant turn emitted during decode, keyed by
/// [`asst_turn_fingerprint`]. On the next request, the multi-turn
/// renderer replays cached tokens at the same turn boundary so the
/// rendered prefix is byte-identical to what was written into KV last
/// turn — required for the LCP-based prompt cache to extend through
/// historical assistant turns (BPE is not bijective; re-encoding a
/// model's emission may produce a different token sequence).
///
/// Cap is configurable via `HIPFIRE_PROMPT_CACHE_CAP` (default 32);
/// `HIPFIRE_PROMPT_CACHE_UNBOUNDED=1` removes the cap entirely. On
/// `insert`, an existing key is moved to MRU; on `get`, the same. When
/// at capacity, the LRU (oldest-touched) entry is evicted.

    // Same matcher used by the qwen35 non-dflash path (see
    // generate() in this file). Approach for dflash differs because
    // spec_step writes KV for ALL committed tokens before we can
    // mask anything — we can't easily reach into the verifier's
    // logits. Strategy: POST-acceptance validation. After each
    // spec_step commits a batch, walk committed tokens through the
    // matcher; if any token violates the grammar (e.g. the Pi
    // turn-12 attractor `<|im_start|>` after `<tool_call>`), stop
    // accepting from that point, treat as EOS, and force a full
    // KV/DN reset before next turn so the polluted slots don't
    // contaminate subsequent generation.
    //
    // The trade-off vs the non-dflash CPU-mask-then-sample path is
    // throughput: dflash with grammar OFF keeps full spec-decode
    // speedup; the rare grammar-violation case terminates the turn
    // early, requiring the client to retry. In production this
    // should be rare — the matcher only constrains during
    // tool_call header emission (~30-50 tokens).
    //
