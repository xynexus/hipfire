//   - `ar_forward_kernel_dirty`: true on init / after kernel module change.

//     lazy hipMalloc happens outside a captured region.
//   - `ar_forward_replay_enabled`: true only after the caller has signalled
//     `end_decode_turn()` AND a capture exists AND kernels are not dirty.
//     Until then, every forward call captures a fresh graph and launches it
//     (correct output per call; cheaper than full direct on amortization).
//
// Why caller-driven commit instead of auto-enable: empirically, captured
// graphs on this codebase + ROCm 7.2.2 sometimes snapshot stale kernarg
// state mid-decode, producing a token-0 attractor on every replay. Gating
// replay until a FULL decode turn completes via the captured-launch path
