//! Grammar-guided decoding for the qwen3.5/3.6 tool-call format.
//!
//! Mirrors the V4F DSML grammar in `crates/hipfire-arch-deepseek4/src/grammar.rs`
//! but constrains qwen35's `<tool_call>{json}</tool_call>` body instead of
//! DeepSeek's XML-style DSML tags.
//!
//! ## Why this exists
//!
//! qwen3.6:27b drifts after long agentic sessions: it emits the
//! `<tool_call>` opener correctly then writes ChatML noise as the body,
//! e.g.
//! ```text
//! <tool_call>
//! <|im_start|>assistant "Let me read the existing build files..."}}
//! </tool_call>
//! ```
//! observed verbatim in Pi turn 12 after ~27k cached tokens. The text
//! isn't JSON, so the daemon's tool-call extractor returns
//! `tool_calls=0`, the daemon emits `finish_reason: "stop"` with that
//! garbage as `message.content`, and Pi's agent loop terminates.
//!
//! The grammar matcher prevents this by masking sample logits the
//! moment the model commits to `<tool_call>`: from then until the JSON
//! header `\n{"name": "<TOOL_NAME>", "arguments": ` is fully laid
//! down, only tokens that continue that template are allowed. The
//! `arguments` value itself is unconstrained (state `InArgs`) — qwen
//! emits free-form JSON for the arguments object and naturally closes
//! with `}\n</tool_call>`. Once `</tool_call>` lands, the matcher
//! returns to free emission.
//!
//! ## States
//!
//! - [`State::Out`] — free emission. The matcher watches for the
//!   `<tool_call>` substring (single special token, vocab id varies
//!   per checkpoint) and transitions to [`State::AfterOpen`] on entry.
//! - [`State::AfterOpen`] — between `<tool_call>` and the
//!   `"arguments": ` colon-space. Constrained to a literal byte
//!   sequence that names one of the available tools.
//! - [`State::InArgs`] — between `"arguments": ` and `</tool_call>`.
//!   Unconstrained — qwen emits the args value as free JSON.
//! - (back to `Out` after `</tool_call>`.)
//!
//! ## What this does NOT do
//!
//! Enforce JSON-validity inside `arguments`. The args value can be a
//! nested object, array, string, etc.; tracking JSON balance under
//! BPE fragmentation would multiply the grammar code size for little
//! payoff — the failure mode we care about (Pi turn 12) corrupts the
//! header, not the body. A future phase can layer in JSON-aware
//! brace counting if production traffic ever shows body drift.
